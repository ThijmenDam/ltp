118,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun.",claim
119,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another's territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax.",premise
120,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.",premise
121,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players.",claim

126,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"But the game keeps going and going, because it would be ""unfair"" to keep going despite the likely outcome.",premise

128,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,perhaps a redesign of the board,premise

132,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.",premise
133,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,I have to ask,claim
134,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"because it's very, very common for people to unwitting ignore or add rules and cause the game to run longer",premise
135,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive, By far the most egregious violation of this nature is ignoring the Auction rule (,premise
136,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"where if the player who lands on an unbought space chooses not to buy it for face value, it is auctioned off to highest bidder",premise
137,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Another common one I grew up with was the ""Free Parking"" rule addition, where landing on Free Parking confers some kind of monetary reward, which introduces more money into the game and makes it harder to go bankrupt, dragging out the game.",premise
138,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Assuming that you're playing with auctions (and preferably without that Free Parking house rule), the key to the game is negotiation.",claim
139,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,The game only becomes a drawn-out slugfest if players can't get monopolies,premise
140,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,which only happens if players don't negotiate,premise
141,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,This is the soul of the game,premise
142,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,ignoring it is the reason many people develop a distaste for the game,premise

147,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,C and D can agree to help each other complete monopolies and make trades of that nature.,premise
148,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Once some players have monopolies, the other players have to either trade to make their own monopolies or get bled out quickly.",premise
149,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Once monopolies (and the corresponding houses and hotels) come into play, tiny rents become enormous and the game quickly comes to an end.",premise
150,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"Monopoly is drawn out because people don't play by the rules, or the miss the main point of the game",claim
151,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,Forming monopolies is by far the quickest way to win,premise
152,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"the easiest way to do so is through negotiating with other players, a point that many Monopoly players fail to notice",premise
153,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,A properly played game of Monopoly may come down to luck in the end,premise
154,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"but it's luck that is heavily influenced by the mid-game, which is decided by the players' diplomatic skill",premise
155,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,Only recently (past 4 years) my family added money to the free parking,premise
156,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,though I always attempted to get the auction rule in I was always voted down,premise
157,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,Perhaps that is the reason why I have such a strong dislike of the game.,claim
158,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,Though it is theoretically sound it may not hold up,claim
159,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,It does admittedly depend a lot on the people you play it with.,claim

161,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,It's like playing poker with players who never bet,premise
162,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"it's not fun, it's just a long, awful slog",premise
163,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,That doesn't make Poker a bad game by design,claim
164,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,even though it can be unfun in some scenarios,premise
165,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,it just means that it's not a game that everyone will enjoy,claim
166,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,I'd recommend pointing out to people that the point of the game is to make trades.,claim
167,97,v2.0/positive/97.xml,positive,"The most beneficial trade I've found involves two players helping each other complete a monopoly, but giving ""immunity"" to that group.",premise
