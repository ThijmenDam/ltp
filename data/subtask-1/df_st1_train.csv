1212,82,v2.0/positive/82.xml,positive,"I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.",premise

1224,82,v2.0/positive/82.xml,positive,You're right about the sexting thing,claim
1225,82,v2.0/positive/82.xml,positive,the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous.,claim
